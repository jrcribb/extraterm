# Download

Extraterm is available in two flavours: the classic Extraterm is based on Electron, and the lighter faster Qt based version which is the future of Extraterm but is in development and lacking features. Both can run on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

* [Try the classic version here](https://github.com/sedwards2009/extraterm/releases/tag/v0.59.4) (versions before 0.60.0)
* [Try the latest Qt based version here](https://github.com/sedwards2009/extraterm/releases) (version 0.60.0 and later

Both can be installed at the same time, without problems.

:warning: Extraterm is in development and roughly 'beta' in quality. It is generally stable, but don't be too surprised if you encounter a few bugs. Use at your own risk. :warning:

With that out of the way, the primary author does use it as their main terminal emulator on a daily basis. The basics are in place and it will run most common terminal applications such as vi, emacs and joe without problems and even more demanding applications such as midnight commander.

Nightly builds of the `master` branch can be [downloaded here](https://storage.googleapis.com/extraterm_builds/index.html).
