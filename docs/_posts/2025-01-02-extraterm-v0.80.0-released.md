This release add a mini-map or "Scroll Map" to the right hand side or terminal sessions, much like that seen in text editors like VSCode. This provides a zoomed out view of the contents of your terminal session, making it easier to navigate long command outputs or to find previous commands.


**Features**

* Added mini-map

**Fixes**

* Bug which caused the terminal size to not propagate to remote TTYs during SSH connecting.
